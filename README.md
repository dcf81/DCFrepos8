Write a README.md that explains your repo. Answer the following in your README.md:

    This repo is about computer operations which range from backing up the system, using different commands when writing scripts, helpdesk support/operations.
    I am learning these skills to serve and maintain operations at a business.
    Google has a lot of information (outdated as well). 
    I do not have a favorite challenge but I do think the helpdesk type assignments were good for me. The learning experience was similar to having to setup the desktop where I had to problem solve and get familiar with the equipment.
    Shell scripting can be used to help back up data that a company has.
    All of them. I would need to make sure I have an understanding on when to use {}, [], and (). I would like to get this down so that I have no errors when running it in Terminal.
    I am unsure.
